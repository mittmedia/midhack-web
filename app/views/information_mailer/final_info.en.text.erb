It is important that everyone feel comfortable and secure at Midhack, therefore we have developed a code of conduct which will apply during the hackathon. These rules can be read at:

The gist of this document is that everyone should be nice to each other and share their knowledge in order to create a fun and educative experience for everyone. All kinds of violence, drugs, harassment or discrimination is forbidden and participants who violate these rules will risk being expelled from the event.

Midhack crew will be taking photographs during the event, if you don't want us to publish any pictures of you, please inform someone in Midhack crew or the photographer directly.
