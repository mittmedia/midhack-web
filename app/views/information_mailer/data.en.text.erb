You are also welcome to use other data sources and tools in addition to the ones mentioned here.
Also, feel free to start investigating interesting data and tools in advance in order to get a head start for the hackathon.

Kan du lova?
============

We are happy to announce that you will gain access to the ”Kan du lova?” ("Can you promise?") data, which was collected before the Swedish parliamentary election in 2014. ”Kan du lova?” is a service built by MittMedia and J++ offering the voters a possibility to ask politicians questions before the election. The data which was generated was used as a basis for journalism and the promises made before the election can be analysed, evaluated and compared to what happened afterwards. We believe that this can be a goldmine with exciting and newsworthy data, maybe even some teams will be able to leave Midhack with a real scoop.

This is also where the data will become available as soon as the application period for Midhack is over. As soon as you gain access to the data you are encouraged to have a look at it. However, MittMedia and Midhack crew would very much appreciate that you do not forward the data to non Midhack attendees.

Overview News
=============

Overview News are indexing international, national and local news (unfortunately restricted to Sweden for the moment) in order to facilitate for journalists and software developers and aims to contribute to more innovation in the news industry. With their API, news data can be integrated into your own systems. The API can also be used to perform advanced searches amongst the indexed articles and allows for sophisticated analyzes. In order to gain access to the Overview News API, an API key is required. These will be sent out to you as soon as the application period for Midhack is over. You will find more info at:
<%= @overviewnews_url %>
